# Flask_car_inventory
Christopher's Flask car inventory for week 5.

My env file contains the below. I did not want to upload the actual thing.

Let me know if I should not have uploaded the migrations directory.

FLASK_APP = car_app
FLASK_ENV = development
DEPLOY_DATABASE_URL = postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:MYPASSWORD@MYHOSTINFO/cars
